"""
RL Trainer Module
Handles offline training from historical fixtures (chronological, day-by-day)
and online updates from new prediction outcomes.

Training constraints:
- Strict chronological order (no future data leakage)
- Season-aware date selection: training starts from each league's actual season
  start date, not a global hardcoded date floor
- Last-10 matches prioritized via recency weighting
- Prediction accuracy is the primary reward signal

Season targeting (--train-season CLI flag):
  "current"     Use each league's current_season (from leagues table). Default.
  "all"         All available seasons, oldest-first. Use for a full cold retraining.
  N (int)       Past season by offset: 1 = most recent past, 2 = two seasons ago, etc.
                Matches the --season N convention used by enrich_leagues.
  "2024/2025"   Explicit season label (split-season format).
  "2025"        Explicit season label (calendar-year format).

Bug fixes applied (2026-03-14):
  FIX-1: PPO ratio was always 1.0 — old_log_prob must be stored BEFORE re-sampling.
          Now uses a stored old_log_prob passed into train_step for Phase 2/3.
  FIX-2: Double KL in Phase 1 — removed the redundant manual KL term;
          F.kl_div IS already KL divergence, the manual re-computation was noise.
  FIX-3: Synthetic odds in Phase 2 reward — now uses xG-derived fair odds per
          fixture rather than a static lookup table, giving match-specific reward signal.
  FIX-4: active_phase default in online updates — update_from_outcomes now explicitly
          passes the correct active_phase so reward logic is never silently wrong.
  FIX-5: Expert probs identical across early dates — _get_rule_engine_probs now falls
          back to league-average xG (1.4 home / 1.1 away) when form data is empty,
          ensuring each match produces a non-constant expert distribution.
  FIX-6: GradNorm clamped at 0.5 constantly — max_norm raised to 1.0 for Phase 2/3
          (imitation still uses 0.5 for stability). Scheduler T_0 raised to 2000 to
          reduce oscillation from premature warm restarts.
  FIX-7: --train-rl runaway caused by silent last-resort fallback. The primary and
          first-fallback paths are fully season-aware and uncapped — the per-league
          leagues.current_season join is the correct boundary. Each league's season
          starts at its own date (August for European leagues, January for calendar-year
          leagues) and a global date cap would be wrong for all of them. The last-resort
          path (no season metadata found at all) now aborts with a clear error message
          directing the operator to run --enrich-leagues, instead of silently
          training on all history back to 2012.
